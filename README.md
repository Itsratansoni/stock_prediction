# stock_prediction
This project employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) in Python for stock price prediction. It entails gathering historical stock data, preprocessing, feature engineering, and splitting data into training, validation, and test sets. Using TensorFlow or Keras, an LSTM model is constructed with appropriate architecture and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. After training and validation, the model's performance is evaluated with metrics like MAE and RMSE. Predicted stock prices are visualized against actual prices. Although predictions offer insights, real-world stock trends are influenced by various factors, warranting cautious decision-making.
